## Description

HiPS tool is developed at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shinshu University, which is a tool design and analysis of Petri nets, developed using Microsoft Visual C #. HiPS tool has a way of intuitive GUI which enable hierarchical and/or timed-net design. HiPS tool has also functions of static/dynamic analysis : T-invariant detection, Reachability path analysis, deadlock state detection, and k-boundedness analysis. In addition, it is possible to perform a random walk simulation with each firing steps.

## Features

* Design Entry based on Hierarchical Petri nets

* Incidence Matrix and Invariant Checking for P/T-net (T-invariant and S-invariant)
* Structural Properties Checking for P/T-net (Structurally Bounded, (Partially) Conservative, (Partially) Repetitive, and (Partially) Consistent)
* Behavioral Analysis for P/T-net (Reachability, Deadlock, Reversibility and Synchronic Distances)
* Liveness and Safeness Properties Checking for Free-Choice (Subclass) net

* Process Trace Graph Generator using High Speed and Memory Efficiency Algorithm
* Multi Threaded Implementations (Partially Support)

* Step-by-Step Random-Walk Simulation for P/T and High-level net
* Timeline Step-Magnitude Continuos Simulation for P/T-net
